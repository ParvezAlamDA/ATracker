Hi,

Reports:
A.	I had a word with shiv regarding this part (shiv in on AL till 29). The SQL is ready and it will be incorporated in the access data base by 1 Apr and the users can select the data range and pull a report containing details regarding AL, SL, WFO Rate. 
B.	I have reconciled the attendance tracker data with Workday Allowance Report and approved extra hours data (which was shared by Nafees on Fri). The file is ready for your review.
C.	We have selected Power BI for the data visualization (due to limited data viz capabilities in access and excel). 
The dash board is ready for your review. I have incorporated the suggestion highlighted by Tarun. Monthly details can be seen by the functional managers, managers regarding the SL%, AL%, WFO%.
