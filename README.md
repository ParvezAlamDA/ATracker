Hi Shiv,

Good Morning!

As discussed earlier, please find below the requirement in the attendance tracker in phase 2.

OBM main page:
1.	Filter day wise (Date range) to view different disposition as unit level (%age) such as AL%, WFH%, WFO% , SL% etc (location wise) and if that helps to see the trend line as well
2.	Meter to donate how much attendance is not updated for current date
3.	Look and feel of the tracker (can be done by us)
4.	In view attendance tab – shift wise should also be extracted (this will help managers to validate the shift allowance for the employees)
Reports:
A.	Leave report at functional manager level and unit level & managers can spool information for themselves (Like date range of report, type of elements such as annual leave, sick leave, WFO rate etc)
B.	Internal attendance tracker should be validated with workday leave report / shift allowance, national holiday report and with Control IQ (this can be again done in phases if too much for 1 time)
C.	Functional manager / unit level monthly trend (Annual leave / sick leave & WFO rate) to be published to all leaders every month

I am happy to discuss once again F2F on the requirements. Before going ahead  with governance process, if this can be done please.

Also, I’m not sure, if you want to keep access as face or excel however I leave it this in your safe hands.
Nafees / Rakesh & Shiv – please add your thoughts, if I have missed anything here!

Again, I will recommend to follow the Agile approach and if you can keep me honest about the delivery timelines please.
